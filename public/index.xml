      <title>New Midas M32 4.0 Firmware</title>

      <description>Introduction
Midas released Version 4.0 of its firmware for their great M32 mixer last week. Since I worked quite a bit using the new version, I would like to document some findings here.
New Features
The new 4.0 release of the M32 firmware brings many new features to the table.
The most obvious feature is the much-improved UI. The darker, more flat UI appeals to me much more than the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; UI of the M32.</description>
