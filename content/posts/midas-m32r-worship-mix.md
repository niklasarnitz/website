# Introduction

A few months ago, our church switched to a Midas M32R as the main mixing console.
We upgraded from a very old Behringer digital desk so it was a quite big upgrade.
Last Friday, we had our first youth service since getting the new console.
Before upgrading to the M32R we used a normal M32 from someone's private possession for our youth services.
Since I’m quite good at using the M32/X32 range of mixers and know them by heart, it wasn’t that big of a problem for me switching to the smaller M32R for this mix.

# Setup

While setting up my routing from home, I noticed that the M32R lacks the one fader bank I was using all the time for BUSes/DCA-Groups. 
This was a real bummer for me because I could easily adjust the main volume of f.e. the drumset or the vocals. 
This first obstacle was not that big of an issue, the bigger issue was getting all the channels routed in a way, that allowed me to easily adjust all of the parameters that needed adjustment during a live performance.
So I did the setup and routing mostly from home using the M32Edit app on my MacBook Pro.
This enabled me to do a rough EQ of all the drums, the vocals and the rest of the instruments.
For that, I used presets from the last youth services as a template.
After setting up at church, I configured my scribble scrip/routing so I had all of the band from channel 1-16 and the rest of the inputs from channel 17-32.
This enabled me to use my usual DCA groups during the service (Drumset, Vocals, Instruments) to quickly change the main volume of those groups but still controll the singular volumes of the different DCA groups on one fader layer.

# Creating the mix

When creating a mix I usually start with placing my mics. We used a relative simple mic setup this time.
