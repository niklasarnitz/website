Enabling the momentarysSwitch mode with the ZBMini from Sonoff is actually quite easy:
1. Pair the ZBMini Zigbee Switch to your Zigbee coordinator
2. Connect a momentary switch to the ZBMini
3. Power the ZBMini
4. Press and keep pressing the switch that is connected to the ZBMini for 5+s.

The ZBMini should now Toggle it's current state, whenever you press the momentary switch.
