## Day One: A looong drive and some ferrying
As I started my long journey from southern Germany up to the nordcap, my first Day was entirely taken up by about 12 hours of driving, then 4 hours of a ferry ride from Hirtshals, Denmark to Langesund, Norway.

I then continued on in Norway to reach the campground at Seljord somewhen around 5pm.

On the way to the campground I stumbled over this beautiful lost place:

I then arrived at Garvikstrondi Camping and booked in for one night (300 NK, around 30 Euros).
Here are some views from my first row tentplace:
